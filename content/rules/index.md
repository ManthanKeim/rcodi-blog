[vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#x201D;RULES&#x201D; font_container=&#x201D;tag:h3|text_align:center&#x201D; use_theme_fonts=&#x201D;yes&#x201D;][vc_column_text]**There are a few rules for participating in the IronHacks:**

*The detailed rules for each IronHack will be announced during the training session for each, but in general:*

1. You can only participate in one IronHack per semester

2.&#xA0;Minimum number of sign-ups: 40, Maximum 80 per hack

3.&#xA0;In the end you will have access to other solutions and you can use them, following Open Access principles.

4.&#xA0;Please work in the virtual crowd&#x2013; apart from each training session, everything&#x2019;s online &#x2013; feel free to post in the IronHacks discussion forum though.

5.&#xA0;It is an individual effort &#x2013; we want to see YOUR skills in action and how YOU use your knowledge, and possibly build upon the knowledge of others.[/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image=&#x201D;4159&#x2033; img_size=&#x201D;full&#x201D; alignment=&#x201D;center&#x201D;][/vc_column][/vc_row]
