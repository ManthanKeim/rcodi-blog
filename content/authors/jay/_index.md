Jia has a B.S. from Purdue in Computer Science. Though she likes all things technical, she loves artistic things just as much. She has worked for a few organizations ( Google, Purdue Supercomputing Center, Singapore airlines as a co-pilot etc. ), and she is just happy to be continuing her PhD at her alma mater.
