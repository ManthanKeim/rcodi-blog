Prior to joining Purdue she was Head of Open Innovation at the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering in Stuttgart, Germany.

Sabine's work is particularly focused on open digital innovation, describing new ways of using information technologies to organize the collective design and use of innovative digital goods. Examples of open digital innovation are: open source software communities, crowdsourcing, digital platforms for mobile, video or smart energy apps, block chains, etc. In her work, she designs and examines systems and technologies that support open digital innovation with respect to their technological and behavioral impact. She uses techniques of computational social science (agent-based modeling, network analysis, experiments) to predict individual as well as collective outcomes in open digital innovation. The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) at Purdue University is the backbone of her work. The center brings together a group of interdisciplinary scholars, students, and tinkerers. As user-inspired researchers she and her team intensively engage with industry partners, policy makers, and individual citizens through large-scale field studies and increasingly also controlled experiments using &#x2018;virtual' contests and user studies. In 2016, she and her team launched **[Purdue IronHacks](http://www.ironhacks.com/)**, a unique virtual multi-staged open data competition, in which students and innovators develop novel and useful apps to solve societal challenges.

Sabine holds a Master in Engineering and Management Science (University of Technology, Darmstadt, Germany), a Master of Commerce with a specialization in Marketing and Entrepreneurship (UNSW, Sydney, Australia), and a PhD in Engineering Sciences (University of Stuttgart, Germany).
