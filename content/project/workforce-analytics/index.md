These efforts allow Indiana residents, businesses and policymakers to leverage innovative opportunities to make better data-driven decisions resulting in improved outcomes across various sectors.

### Ironhacks: Collaboration with the Indiana Management Performance Hub (MPH)

[IronHacks](http://www.ironhacks.com/) is a unique one month, 5-stage innovative hacking program and competition for individuals who want to create impact from open data. Participants use at least two open data sets to build a novel and useful web application with interactive visualizations.

The [Indiana Management Performance Hub (MPH)](http://www.in.gov/mph/) seeks to address complex management and policy issues by providing access to data and analytics driven solutions in the areas of healthcare, education and workforce, and more. These efforts allow Indiana residents, businesses and policymakers to leverage innovative opportunities to make better data-driven decisions resulting in improved outcomes across various sectors.

As a part of the IronHacks collaboration with MPH, students have an opportunity to create digital open data solutions to real world problems that affect governance and policy decisions at a state level. Workforce development issues including talent creation and retention are key challenges for educators, employers and legislators in managing sustainable community development and economic stability in a rapidly evolving technology-based ecosystem. During this learning experience and competition, students build programming and data science skills while collaborating with MPH mentors to better understand the policy implications of their data-based web applications. Further, as a result of their interactions, students may have the opportunity for additional engagement with supporting organizations all while enhancing their intellectual and professional development skillsets.
