This project promotes more rigorous forms to understand open design experiments.
In this research project, the RCODI had identified an increasing need for an artifact that allows the research community to assess crowdsourcing phenomena in a more rigorous form. This scientific artifact enables the research community with the tools to systemically alter the conditions where the crowd will be exposed. Some of the conditions that are available for simple modifications are: task complexity components, transparency of information, communication between agents, among others. This  project uses IronHacks platform as an instance of the scientific artifact solution
